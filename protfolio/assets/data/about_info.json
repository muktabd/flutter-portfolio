                "brief": "I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). During my studies, I began coding to solve real-life problems, which sparked my passion for software development.\nAfter graduation, I immediately started my professional career as a mobile application developer. Over the past four years, I have been dedicated to building high-quality mobile apps. My interest in expanding my skill set led me to explore JavaScript technologies. I have since learned Node.js for backend API development and Vue.js for frontend web applications.\nCurrently, I work as a full-stack developer, capable of delivering high-performance, scalable, and secure applications across Android, iOS, and Web platforms. Also able to play a role for lead developer to develop a fresh project."
